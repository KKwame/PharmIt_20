most of the comments are in the code already
the data variable in the function in the makediagnose pane is the list variable that is from the users choices. 1's and zero

if successfully passed to the model it should return 1 for cholera or 0 for malaria


you can use the variouscurepane.dart file or viewstatspane.dart file to display either malarai or the cholera after prediction.
